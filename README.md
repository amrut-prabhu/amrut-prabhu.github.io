# Amrut Prabhu- Portfolio Page

## Setup

- Run `npm install` in order to get all the Gulp dev dependencies.
- Run `Gulp watch` to compile the Sass and minify the JavaScript.

  Alternatively, if you don't have Gulp installed globally, you can do `npm run watch`. Any changes done to the JavaScript (`js/scripts.js`) or Sass (`sass/styles.scss`) will be autocompiled and ready to go.

All scripts are within `js/scripts.js` and get minified to `js/scripts.min.js`. All styles are in `sass/styles.scss` and get compiled to `css/styles.css`. Both the minified scripts file and compiled CSS file are what is loaded on the page by default.
